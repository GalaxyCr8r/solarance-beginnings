### 4.1. **Construction:**
*   Blueprint acquisition (research, purchase, looting).
*   Resource requirements (significant).
*   **Build Time:** Significant, potentially hours to days for larger structures, requiring sustained resource delivery by construction ships/drones.
*   Placement rules and restrictions (system sovereignty, proximity to other stations).
### 4.2. **Modules & Functionality:**
*   Production (wares, ships, modules).
*   Storage (Solid, Liquid, Container).
*   Habitats (Workforce).
*   Defense (Turrets, shield generators).
*   Shipyards & Equipment Docks.
*   Trade Docks / Trading Stations.
*   Research Labs.
### 4.3. **Management:**
*   Assigning a Station Manager (NPC or Player with Faction Rank).
*   Setting buy/sell orders, production levels.
*   Managing workforce, energy, and resource flow.
*   Assigning defense fleets.
### 4.4. **Destruction & Sieges:**
*   **Initiation:** How is a siege declared/started?
*   **Timeframe:** Takes multiple real-world days to destroy a well-defended, high-tier station.
*   **Phases of Destruction (Example):**
    *   *Phase 1: Shield Overload (Hours):* Focus fire to deplete massive shields. Shields might regenerate slowly if pressure lets up.
    *   *Phase 2: Hull Breach (1-2 Days):* Sustained damage to specific hardpoints or overall hull. Repair efforts by defenders are crucial.
    *   *Phase 3: Core Collapse (Final Hours):* Targeting critical station core. Once breached, countdown to destruction.
*   **Active Siege Mechanics:** What can attackers/defenders *do* during these days?
    *   Attackers: Maintain siege lines, interdict repair ships, probe defenses, launch boarding parties (if a mechanic).
    *   Defenders: Repair damage, call in reinforcements, sally out to harass attackers, manage internal resources to keep defenses online.
*   **"Off-Hour" Considerations:** What happens when the majority of a faction is offline? Reduced vulnerability? Automatic defense protocols? (This is critical).
*   **Consequences of Destruction:** Total loss? Partial wreckage for salvage? "Asset safety" for some items?
