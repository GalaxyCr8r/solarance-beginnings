This page is still a WIP.

There could be two modes - system travel mode and sector mode.
The point would be to save on calculations by having most space ships be in an abstracted "system travel mode" which will have NO velocity tracking and it would be outside of any normal sector. Once you approach a sector you'll go into high resolution/velocity tracking mode.
### 5.1. **Ship Classes:**
A basic class set up would be:
*   S (Small)
	* Fighter
	* Shuttle
*   M (Medium)
	* Corvette
	* Frigate
	* Freighter
*   L (Large)
	* Destroyer
	* Tanker
	* Research Vessel
	* Battle Cruiser
*   XL (Capital/Station-equivalent movers)
	* Colony Ship
	* Carrier
	* Dreadnaught
### 5.2. **Ship Roles:**
*   Fighters, Interceptors, Bombers
*   Freighters, Miners
*   Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers
*   Carriers, Auxiliaries
### 5.3. **Customization:**
*   Weapons, turrets, shields, engines, thrusters
*   Software (trade, combat, navigation)
*   Internal modules
### 5.4. **Controls (Top-Down):**
*   **Direct Control:** WASD/Mouse for player-piloted ship.
*   **Fleet Command:** (Perhaps for high ranking Faction players?) RTS-style selection, formation, and orders (attack, move, patrol, dock, trade, mine).
### 5.5. **AI Piloting:**
*   Configurable behavior for automated traders, miners, and combat patrols (owned by players/factions).
