Currently I have NO PLANS on how to monetize this game. If this reaches MVP it will behoove me to apply some thought about how to tastefully add some reason for people to give me money so I can at least pay for hosting. Hopefully, find a win-win solution that doesn't:
* Put gameplay resources, abilities, or features behind a paywall (Pay-to-win)
* Punish players for playing too long (Energy)
	* Though, part of the tenets of this game is to encourage long-term play. Especially for Dad's like me who can't be logged in for more than an hour at a time.
### 12.1. **Model:**
*   (e.g., Buy-to-Play, Subscription, Cosmetic Microtransactions).
### 12.2. **Philosophy:**
*   Avoid Pay-to-Win, ensure fairness.
