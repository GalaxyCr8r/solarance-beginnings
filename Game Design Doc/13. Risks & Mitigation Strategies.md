### 13.1. **Station Siege Burnout/Frustration:**
*   ***Risk:*** Players find multi-day sieges boring, unfair if offline, or too punishing.
*   ***Mitigation:*** Explore active defense/offense mechanics, vulnerability windows, staged destruction allowing recovery, partial asset safety.
### 13.2. **New Player Experience:**
*   ***Risk:*** New players overwhelmed, griefed, or unable to find resources.
*   ***Mitigation:*** Starter zones, robust tutorial, anti-gank systems in safe areas, instanced early missions.
### 13.3. **Economic Imbalance:**
*   ***Risk:*** Hyperinflation, deflation, monopolies, resource stagnation.
*   ***Mitigation:*** NPC economic sinks/faucets, careful resource distribution, trade taxes, tools for GMs to monitor/intervene.
### 13.4. **Faction Power Discrepancy ("Rich get Richer"):**
*   ***Risk:*** Established factions dominate, making it impossible for new ones to rise.
*   ***Mitigation:*** Catch-up mechanics, diminishing returns for massive empires, opportunities for smaller factions (e.g., guerrilla warfare, specialized economies), "underdog" bonuses.
### 13.5. **Technical Challenges of MMO Scale:**
*   ***Risk:*** Server instability, lag, database issues.
*   ***Mitigation:*** Phased rollout, stress testing, scalable architecture, experienced network engineers.
### 13.6. **Content Pacing for Faction Tiers:**
*   ***Risk:*** Players get bored before reaching high-tier faction content.
*   ***Mitigation:*** Ensure engaging gameplay and meaningful progression at *all* faction tiers and for solo/small group players.
