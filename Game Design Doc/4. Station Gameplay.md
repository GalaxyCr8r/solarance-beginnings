### 4.1. **Construction:**
*   Blueprint acquisition (research, purchase, looting).
*   Resource requirements (significant).
*   **Build Time:** Significant, potentially hours for outpost/defense platforms/depots to days for larger structures, requiring sustained resource delivery by construction ships/drones.
*   Placement rules and restrictions (system sovereignty, proximity to other stations).
### 4.2. **Modules & Functionality:**
Initially, larger stations might be homogenous in their features. Eventually having stations require additional models to function beyond just being a safe haven to dock at should be required:
*   Production (wares, ships, modules).
*   Storage (Solid, Liquid, Container).
*   Habitats (Workforce).
*   Defense (Turrets, shield generators).
*   Shipyards & Equipment Docks.
*   Trade Docks / Trading Stations.
*   Research Labs.
### 4.3. **Management:**
*   Assigning a Station Manager (NPC or Player with Faction Rank).
*   Setting buy/sell orders, production levels.
*   Managing workforce, energy, and resource flow.
*   Assigning NPC defense fleets.
### 4.4. **Destruction & Sieges:**
This part is very much in flux and open to discussion. The core of whatever mechanic(s) are decided should be to avoid Rust (the game) type shenanigan's where your base can be looted/destroyed in a single night.
*   **Initiation:** How is a siege declared/started?
*   **Timeframe:** Takes multiple real-world days to destroy a well-defended, high-tier station.
*   **Phases of Destruction (Example):**
    *   *Phase 1: Shield Overload (Hours):* Focus fire to deplete massive shields. Shields might regenerate slowly if pressure lets up.
    *   *Phase 2: Hull Breach (1-2 Days):* Sustained damage to specific hardpoints or overall hull. Repair efforts by defenders are crucial.
    *   *Phase 3: Core Collapse (Final Hours):* Targeting critical station core. Once breached, countdown to destruction.
*   **Active Siege Mechanics:** What can attackers/defenders *do* during these days?
    *   Attackers: Maintain siege lines, interdict repair ships, probe defenses, launch boarding parties (if a mechanic).
    *   Defenders: Repair damage, call in reinforcements, sally out to harass attackers, manage internal resources to keep defenses online.
*   **"Off-Hour" Considerations:** What happens when the majority of a faction is offline? Reduced vulnerability? Automatic defense protocols? (This is critical).
*   **Consequences of Destruction:** Total loss? Partial wreckage for salvage? "Asset safety" for some items?
