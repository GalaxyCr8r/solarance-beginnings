# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a server-to-player messaging system that allows the SpacetimeDB server to send targeted messages to specific players or groups of players. This system will be used to provide feedback for failed actions (like cargo trading failures), system notifications, and administrative messages. The messaging system must be secure, efficient, and integrate seamlessly with the existing chat interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive immediate feedback when my actions fail, so that I understand why the action was unsuccessful and can take corrective measures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player attempts to buy/sell cargo at a station and the action fails THEN the system SHALL send a private message explaining the failure reason
2. WHEN a player attempts any game action that fails validation (such as username already taken during player creation, insufficient resources for purchases, invalid target selections, or constraint violations) THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback through the messaging system
3. WHEN a server message is received THEN the client SHALL display it in a dedicated server message channel in the chat interface
4. IF a player is offline when a server message is sent THEN the system SHALL store the message for delivery when the player reconnects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game administrator, I want to send messages to individual players or groups of players, so that I can provide targeted notifications, warnings, or information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator calls a server reducer with a target player and message THEN the system SHALL deliver the message only to that specific player
2. WHEN an administrator sends a message to a group THEN the system SHALL deliver the message to all members of the specified group
3. WHEN a group message is sent with a group name THEN recipients SHALL see the group name in the message display
4. WHEN a group message is sent without a group name THEN recipients SHALL see it as a direct server message
5. IF a player is not authorized to send server messages THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an appropriate error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player receiving group messages, I want to see the group context without seeing other group members, so that my privacy is maintained while still understanding the message context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player receives a group message THEN they SHALL see the group name if provided
2. WHEN a player receives a group message THEN they SHALL NOT see the list of other recipients
3. WHEN a player receives a group message THEN the message SHALL be clearly distinguished from direct messages
4. WHEN multiple group messages are received THEN each SHALL display its respective group context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server messaging system to integrate with existing reducers, so that any game action can easily send feedback messages to players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any reducer needs to send a message to a player THEN it SHALL be able to call a simple utility function
2. WHEN a message is sent from a reducer THEN it SHALL not interrupt the reducer's primary logic flow
3. WHEN the messaging system is used THEN it SHALL follow the existing SpacetimeDB patterns and conventions
4. WHEN messages are stored THEN they SHALL use appropriate database indexing for efficient retrieval

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want server messages to be clearly distinguished from player chat messages, so that I can easily identify official communications and feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server messages are displayed in the chat interface THEN they SHALL have distinct visual styling
2. WHEN server messages appear THEN they SHALL be in a separate channel or clearly marked section
3. WHEN server messages are mixed with other chat THEN they SHALL use different colors, fonts, or formatting
4. WHEN a server message is urgent or error-related THEN it SHALL have appropriate visual priority

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want message delivery to be reliable and trackable, so that I can ensure important communications reach their intended recipients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a server message is sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery status
2. WHEN a message fails to deliver THEN the system SHALL log the failure with appropriate details
3. WHEN a player has unread server messages THEN the system SHALL provide a way to query unread count
4. WHEN message history is needed THEN the system SHALL provide efficient retrieval of past server messages
