# Ship Entities & Basic World!

> Goal: Build your world logic â€” players exist in ships, and the world has some life.

âœ… Deliverables:

- Ship stats: shields, cargo, maybe simple health.
- Floating resources (asteroids, debris, etc).
- Basic mining mechanic (press a key near asteroid to "mine").
- World persistence: mined asteroids stay gone.

ðŸ’¡ Playable Test: Players fly around, mine resources, and the world remembers.
