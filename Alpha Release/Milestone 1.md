# Core Movement & Networking!

> Goal: Establish the bones of a MMO â€” multiplayer flight in a shared space.

âœ… Deliverables:

- Macroquad client: Top-down space movement, inertia, basic UI.
- SpacetimeDB server: Track and replicate player positions.
- Minimal login system (temporary usernames or UUID).
- One shared star system or sector.

ðŸ’¡ Playable Test: Players can log in, see each other fly around in a persistent space.
