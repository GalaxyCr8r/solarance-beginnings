The goal of this release is to get a vertical slice of gameplay available to players. The key two pillars are:

1. Station Building
	1. Players must be able to come together and build stations for their factions. A subset of [[4. Station Gameplay]]
2. Faction Creation
	1. Players must be able to form their own groups within the larger faction. Possibly up to Small Organization e.g. [[3. Faction System]]
